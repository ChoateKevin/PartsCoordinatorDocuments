# Parts Coordinator Documentation

The objective of the Body Shop Parts Coordinator is to serve the Body Shop Technicians. This objective is reached by maximizing the efficiency in dispursing the body shop parts order. 

The most successful Parts Coordinators achieve this goal by knowing where the parts are at all times. Therefore if you do nothing else, document where the parts are at all times.

Let this guide be a reference to obtaining that efficiency. 

## Quick Overview
---
The 10,000 foot view of the Body Shop Parts Coordinator boils down to three steps.

1. Collecting parts
2. Staging parts
3. Dispersing parts

The problem we are solving is for the Body Shop Technicians. When a car is in accident, a large number of parts from different domains of the car are broken. The dealership does not have the capacity to hold all of these parts.

The Parts Department must then order all of the different parts from sources such as manufacturer, after market or LKQ.

These parts arrive at different times and sources. This is where you come in. You coordinate these parts and make sure they make it to the right technician.

## Shelf Tickets
---
### Pulling Parts
Pulling "shelf tickets" as they are commonly refered to is a large portion of your job. The shelf tickets is a list of locations, part numbers, description of the part and quantity. 

Shelf tickets will also have green label stickers stapled to them. These are provided by the counterman who bills out the parts. Should you need more you may return to them.  

Your objective here is to pulling the corresponding parts and assign them to a staging bin.

#### **Procedure**
1. Remove Shelf Ticket from blue file holder from in between the body shop parts countermen.
2. Quickly review the shelf ticket for any special notes and make sure you know where all the locations are. If any questions now is the time to as a counterman.
>*Effciency Tip* - Cross out any parts with 0 quantity. You may accidently spend time searching for a part only to find out that you were not supposed to pull it yet or you pull it and it was not meant for that order and now another order will be short that part.

3. Grab a cart and small plastic bag with a sealable top.
4. With cart, bag, shelf ticket, stickers, and pen, you may now start by heading to the first bin location listed. You can ignore any parts with no bin location or 0 quantity unless othewise specified by the counterman.
5. Once arrived at the corresponding bin location. Look in the bin location and retrieve the part.
6. Compare the part number on the shelf ticket to the one printed on the part label. 
>*Troubleshooting* - If there is no label on the part, you make look for a label left in the bin location. If there is still no label, for example really small rivets, double check your bin location and if correct, you may assume it is the correct part.
7. Once you have the correct part, mark on your shelf ticket that you have that part, place a green label sticker on the part, and place it into your cart.
>*Effciency Tip* - Very small parts, like screws, bolts, and rivets are kept in the small baggie with a sealable top. You can use one green label for everything in the baggie. 
8. Then repeat steps 5 through 7 until you have completed your shelf ticket.
9. With your completed cart head up to the third floor if you are already not there and look at the size of your order and available staging bins. 
10. Before selecting a staging bin look through your order for any Special Place Parts.
11. At this time place any Special Place Parts into their corresponding location and mark on your shelf ticket which part and location. 
12. Now look at the size of your order and your available bins. Choose a staging bin that corresponds to the size of your order and write this down on your shelf ticket.
>*Efficiency Tip* - Also look at your shelf ticket and see how many more parts are listed. Even though you may only have a few parts with you today, but you know there is going to be a large quantity more. You may go ahead and give it a bigger bin now. This is your choice and will come easier with experience. This decsion can take up a lot of you time, dont let it. Remember as long as you document any changes, you can always move parts to a bigger or smaller bin location. 
13. Move the parts from your cart to the bin.
14. Arrange the parts in a clean and orderly fashion with the green labels facing out. 
15. If you have 3 or more small loose parts, create a medium sized plastic bag from the U-line bag maker and place them in there. Small loose parts are thing like reflectors, small brackets, or glues. 
16. At this point you should have no more parts and only your shelf ticket with the bin location, any location for special place parts and any notes. 
17. Head to the computer and access your parts order in Rome.
18. In your parts order update the bin, override any special bin locations and input a note explaining the location of everything. The more detailed you are here the faster you will be a dispersing your parts.
#### **Special Place Parts**
This is a list of parts with unique locations.
| Part | Location |
|-------|---------|
|Bumper|Annex|
|Lower Cover|Third Floor|
|Lights|Third Floor|
|Hanging Fenders|3B07|
|Boxed Fenders|Annex|
|Doors|Annex|
|Hoods|Annex|
|Long/Large Square Boxes| Third Floor|
|Steering Gears|Third Floor|

#### **Troubleshooting**
- There is no label or part number on my part.
  - Double check the bin location for any form of a label that may have been torn off by a previous parts employee and left there for confirmation. Check the shipping label, sometimes they will print the last seven digits of the parts number. With a small part double check the bin location and if correct, it is safe to assume it is the correct part.
- The part quanity is less than what is called for.
  - Double check with the service team for the part. In some cases the part has not been restocked yet, but is in the building. If the part is not in either location, notate this on your shelf ticket by crossing out the amount required and writing in how many you obtained. Then notify the Body Shop Counterman.
- The current bin location is too small for my parts.
  - This is super common. Often part orders begin with one or two parts. Collect all the parts from the previous bin location and the ones you have and move them to a large bin. Notate this in Rome by updating the bin location and writing a custom note saying what you did.


## Special Order Parts
---
With the average car having over 30,000 parts, there is no way we could store them all to be ready at any moment. Here is where Special Order Parts or SOPs come into play. 

The Body Shop Counterman will order parts for the job and they will come in over time as SOPs. These work very similart to shelf tickets other than they do not have a bin location. 

They come in with the shelf parts. Service will then sort them out and place them in the designated Special Order Parts Area. 

From here you will collect them and place them in their staging bin.
