# Parts Coordinator Documentation

The objective of the Body Shop Parts Coordinator is to serve the Body Shop Technicians. This objective is reached by maximizing the efficiency in dispursing the body shop parts order. 

The most successful Parts Coordinators achieve this goal by knowing where the parts are at all times. Therefore if you do nothing else, document where the parts are at all times.

Let this guide be a reference to obtaining that efficiency. 

## Quick Overview
---
The 10,000 foot view of the Body Shop Parts Coordinator boils down to three steps.

1. Collecting parts
2. Staging parts
3. Dispersing parts

The problem we are solving is for the Body Shop Technicians. When a car is in accident, a large number of parts from different domains of the car are broken. The dealership does not have the capacity to hold all of these parts.

The Parts Department must then order all of the different parts from sources such as manufacturer, after market or LKQ.

These parts arrive at different times and sources. This is where you come in. You coordinate these parts and make sure they make it to the right technician.

## Shelf Tickets
---
### **Pulling Parts**
Pulling "shelf tickets" as they are commonly refered to is a large portion of your job. The shelf tickets is a list of locations, part numbers, description of the part and quantity. 

Shelf tickets will also have green label stickers stapled to them. These are provided by the counterman who bills out the parts. Should you need more you may return to them.  

Your objective here is to pulling the corresponding parts and assign them to a staging bin.

#### **Procedure**
1. Remove Shelf Ticket from blue file holder from in between the body shop parts countermen.
2. Quickly review the shelf ticket for any special notes and make sure you know where all the locations are. If any questions now is the time to as a counterman.
>*Effciency Tip* - Cross out any parts with 0 quantity. You may accidently spend time searching for a part only to find out that you were not supposed to pull it yet or you pull it and it was not meant for that order and now another order will be short that part.

3. Grab a cart and small plastic bag with a sealable top.
4. With cart, bag, shelf ticket, stickers, and pen, you may now start by heading to the first bin location listed. You can ignore any parts with no bin location or 0 quantity unless othewise specified by the counterman.
5. Once arrived at the corresponding bin location. Look in the bin location and retrieve the part.
6. Compare the part number on the shelf ticket to the one printed on the part label. 
>*Troubleshooting* - If there is no label on the part, you make look for a label left in the bin location. If there is still no label, for example really small rivets, double check your bin location and if correct, you may assume it is the correct part.
7. Once you have the correct part, mark on your shelf ticket that you have that part, place a green label sticker on the part, and place it into your cart.
>*Effciency Tip* - Very small parts, like screws, bolts, and rivets are kept in the small baggie with a sealable top. You can use one green label for everything in the baggie. 
8. Then repeat steps 5 through 7 until you have completed your shelf ticket.
9. With your completed cart head up to the third floor if you are already not there and look at the size of your order and available staging bins. 
10. Before selecting a staging bin look through your order for any Special Place Parts.
11. At this time place any Special Place Parts into their corresponding location and mark on your shelf ticket which part and location. 
12. Now look at the size of your order and your available bins. Choose a staging bin that corresponds to the size of your order and write this down on your shelf ticket.
>*Efficiency Tip* - Also look at your shelf ticket and see how many more parts are listed. Even though you may only have a few parts with you today, but you know there is going to be a large quantity more. You may go ahead and give it a bigger bin now. This is your choice and will come easier with experience. This decsion can take up a lot of you time, dont let it. Remember as long as you document any changes, you can always move parts to a bigger or smaller bin location. 
13. Move the parts from your cart to the bin.
14. Arrange the parts in a clean and orderly fashion with the green labels facing out. 
15. If you have 3 or more small loose parts, create a medium sized plastic bag from the U-line bag maker and place them in there. Small loose parts are thing like reflectors, small brackets, or glues. 
16. At this point you should have no more parts and only your shelf ticket with the bin location, any location for special place parts and any notes. 
17. Head to the computer and access your parts order in Rome.
18. In your parts order update the bin, override any special bin locations and input a note explaining the location of everything. The more detailed you are here the faster you will be a dispersing your parts.
#### **Special Place Parts**
This is a list of parts with unique locations.
| Part | Location |
|-------|---------|
|Bumper|Annex|
|Lower Cover|Third Floor|
|Lights|Third Floor|
|Hanging Fenders|3B07|
|Boxed Fenders|Annex|
|Doors|Annex|
|Hoods|Annex|
|Long/Large Square Boxes| Third Floor|
|Steering Gears|Third Floor|

#### **Troubleshooting**
- There is no label or part number on my part.
  - Double check the bin location for any form of a label that may have been torn off by a previous parts employee and left there for confirmation. Check the shipping label, sometimes they will print the last seven digits of the parts number. With a small part double check the bin location and if correct, it is safe to assume it is the correct part.
- The part quanity is less than what is called for.
  - Double check with the service team for the part. In some cases the part has not been restocked yet, but is in the building. If the part is not in either location, notate this on your shelf ticket by crossing out the amount required and writing in how many you obtained. Then notify the Body Shop Counterman.
- The current bin location is too small for my parts.
  - This is super common. Often part orders begin with one or two parts. Collect all the parts from the previous bin location and the ones you have and move them to a large bin. Notate this in Rome by updating the bin location and writing a custom note saying what you did.


## Special Order Parts
---
With the average car having over 30,000 parts, there is no way we could store them all to be ready at any moment. Here is where Special Order Parts or SOPs come into play. 

The Body Shop Counterman will order parts for the job and they will come in over time as SOPs. These work very similart to shelf tickets other than they do not have a bin location. 

They come in with the shelf parts. Service will then sort them out and place them in the designated Special Order Parts Area. From here you will collect them and place them in their staging bin. 

### **Take-To's**

Take-To's are SOPs that have come in after the other parts have already been sent to the technician. Meaning the technician is actively working on and in need of those parts. These have priority of the other SOPs. They go straight to the technician instead of the bin unless otherwise stated.

#### **Procedure**
1. Collect the Take-To tickets from the blue file holder.
2. Fimilarize your self with the RO number and Part Description.
3. If unfamilar with the part description, google the part number and look at the image.
4. Pick up a SOP fromt he SOP area and read the White Service Label. This will have the RO number, Part number and description. 
5. If a match place in your cart with a green sticker and move on to the next part. 
6. If not place the SOP into a different area, so that you do not get confused and look at it again.
>*Efficiency Tip* - Using the white label group the parts that are not on your Take-To based on RO number. This will expadite the search when you get to SOP tickets.
7. Once you have located all of the Take-To part and they have been labeled and marked down. Take them to the corresponding tech.

### **Special Order Parts**

#### **Procedure**
1. Collect the SOP tickets from the blue file holder.
2. If they are not already orginize your SOP tickets by the RO number, either ascedending or descending. Your Choice.
3. Pick up an SOP part and read the White Service Parts label. 
4. Match the RO number on the White Label with your SOP ticket that has that RO.
5. Look through the list of Part Numbers on the SOP ticket and confirm that it matches.
6. If the numbers match, mark that one found and place a green label on the part. If the numbers do not match place aside to not get confused with other parts.
> **SPECIAL PROCEDURE** - All metal pieces, i.e. door, hood, fender, must be inspected by a body shop counterman before taken upstairs and to its bin location. They may need to have futher inspection by a technician. In that scenario the part will stay downstairs until the technician says so. 
7. You can place your found part on the cart or elevator depending on side.
>*Efficiency Tip* - Place your parts on the car or elevator together so it is easier to place in their bin when you get to the third floor. Also place the SOP ticket with the parts when completed so that you know that ticket is done.
8. Repeat until you have no more SOP tickets left.
>*Efficiency Tip* - With bumpers, doors, headlights or any large boxes. Take a piece of packaging tape and tape over the green label. This prevents the label falling off. An unlabeled part will never be found easily.
9. Once all your parts are collected and on the elevator. Head to the third floor.
10. At the third floor completly unload the elevator, so that other associates can use it as needed.
11. Place the cart and Parts in the middle of the aisle. 
12. At this time look to see if you have any Special Place Parts. 
13. Move any Special Place Parts to their corresponding place and update their location in ROME.
14. Next pick an order and look Rome to see if it has a bin location.
15. If a bin location is set, place order in that bin location.
16. If bin location is blank or too small. Gather all the parts and find a new bin location. Don't forget to write the bin location on your SOP ticket.
17. Head back to the computer and update ROME. 
18. Repeat steps 14 - 17 until all SOP are put away.

#### **Troubleshooting**
- What if I can't find a SOP or Take-To part
  - Often the part is still there but so mixed up its hard to find. I generally work though the pile and it will show up. If the pile is already empty and you are still missing the part get with your body shop counterman and service. Sometimes service will stock the part by accident or the part will be inspected and not the normal spot. 


## Parts Order
---

This is your highest priority in addition to Take-To's. The technician is waiting on the parts to get started or complete a customers car. 

#### **Procedure**
1. Parts Orders begin with either a Text Message or Phone Call.
   - It is polite to text the technician back so they know thier order has been recieved.
2. Read the message and take in consideration of any notes
   - An example here could be that a bodyman only needs the door and fender to mock it up, but not all of the parts.
3. Head to ROME and go to the Parts Dispatch.
4. Select all of the parts called for by the technician.
   - Don't forget to read any notes for this RO. 
5. Take the printed Parts Order and cart to the bin where the parts are held.
6. Starting with any part match it's part number with the part number on the sheet. 
7. Mark on the sheet that the part has been recieved and move on to the next part.
8. If the part was not on your sheet, then place back in the bin location, but seperate to not get confused with unchecked parts.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 until all parts on your Parts Order are marked and on your cart.
>*Efficency Tip* - You are not expected to count out rivets, screws, nuts, etc. It is assumed that at the time of shelf ticket they were measure out correctly. However, be smart about it. It the Order calls for 6 different kinds of rivets and you have one kind. You are missing some parts and this warrants investigation.
10. You may have go to your Special Place to retrevie the Special Place Parts. This should be marked on your sheet and in the notes. 
11. Once all parts are on your cart. Head to the technician who ordered the parts.

#### **Missing Parts**
Missing parts are so common on Parts Orders. Here are the steps effective in finding a missing part. 

1. Quickly go through the parts you have currently and make sure you did not get in a hurry and forgot to mark it down.
2. Look in the bins to the left, right, above and below your current bin for the part. 
3. Double Check the notes for any clues or previous bins. 
4. Check previous bins.
5. In Rome, Check the date the part was recieved. If today or yesterday, it may still be downstairs in SOP or on a Shelf ticket. At that point you can go pull it from the shelf and keep going. 
6. Next check the invoice by restoring it and reading the comments. You are looking for Shelf or SOP and where it said to bring it. 
7. It it is a shelf ticket and the part has a bin location, double check the on hand quanitiy. It is possilbe you forgot to pull it and they would be off by amount you were supposed to pull. 
8. If a Special Place Part check all Special Place Part Locations not just the designated location. 
9. If after 10 or more minutes you are still missing the part, contact a body shop counterman for an assist. They will likely go through the same process you just did. Don't feel bad if they find it in two minutes. Often your eyes can go numb by staring at the same boxes all day and you just needed fresh eys. 
10. In some rare cases the part is actually lost and a new one will need to be ordered.

#### **Troubleshooting**
- What if the technician does not need what I brought him?
  - Take the parts back up stairs and place them in thier bin. Don't forget to update ROME that the technician did not recieve those parts and undispatch them.
- What if a part is broken?
  - Retrieve Part from technician and bring to body shop counterman. Ask the technician to show you where it is broken so you can relay this information to the body shop counterman. Try to keep orginal packaging
- What if I brought them the wrong part?
  - Ask the technicican if you brought them the wrong part from the bin, did they order the wrong part of did the manufacturer send the wrong part. 
    - If you brought them the wrong part. Retrieve the wrong part and bring out correct part. Notate everything in ROME
    - If they ordered the wrong part or manufacturer sent the wrong part. Bring the wrong part to the body shop counterman with orginal packaging.
- What if they ask for a part that is not on the ticket?
  - You do not have the power to order parts. You may relay this information to the body shop counterman or ask the technician to talk to them directly if you do not feel comfortable you would get it right. 
- What if I get multiple orders at once?
  - This is super common. Best practice is to acknowledge their order so they know its in the queue. Next print all orders out that you have. Do the smallest order first so that technician can go ahead and get started. Next just go one order at a time. You can only do your best. Try not to let it frustrate you.
